# Dev Process Checklist

Adapted from the tech test checklist used at Makers Academy

## Testing

* Commit history clearly shows evidence of a thorough TDD process.
  * Each commit diff shows a unit test or cohesive set of unit tests and the corresponding source code.
* Dependencies have been mocked (including e.g. Time).
* Ideally test for behaviour rather than state (could be via another method).
* Clear test descriptions.

## Design

* Justify the classes used and design.
* Short methods fewer than 10 lines, ideally less than 5.
* Short classes fewer than 60 lines, ideally less than 30.
